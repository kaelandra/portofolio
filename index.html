                    <p class="card-text">I enjoy writing stories and reading books. Both are ways i explore emotions, perspective, and the human condition. Speaking of that, i have a growing curiosity about psychology. I'm fascinated by how the mind works, what drives human behaviour, and how our thoughts shape who we are.</p>

There’s something about the rush, the teamwork, and the quiet focus it brings that i really enjoy. It’s not always about winning, sometimes it’s just about zoning out, clicking into the moment, and letting the world pause for a bit.</p>
